# Construct Summary

The authors aimed to develop a measure that can

>"evaluate the workload that is attributed to the overall human-robot system configuration." (p. 305)

Mental workload is defined as:

>"an inferred construct that mediates between task difficulty, operator skill, and observed performance" (p. 304)

They report 5 dimensions and define them as follows:

>Task: the individual elements that are involved in the mission at hand.
>System: The system is comprised of the robot, operator control unit, interface, and, but not limited to, the payload (camera)
>Team Process: Processes involved with working with team members. A team can be defined as 2 or more entities (human and/or robot) working together. Processes can include communication, coordination, backup, etc.
>Team configuration: Human-to-robot ratio during the mission. Relative spatial location of each team member (human and/or robot) during the mission.
>Context: The environment, mission scenario, and other external factors that may contribute to workload.
