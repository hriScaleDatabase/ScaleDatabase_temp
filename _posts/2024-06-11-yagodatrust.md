# Construct Summary

The authors define the construct of trust as follows: 

>"The basis of trust is the information that notifies the person about the ability of the trustee to achieve specific goals [15]. Thus, the basis of trust provides the underlying characteristics used to describe and utilize the construct of trust... The basis of trust is grouped by three characteristics: performance, function, and semantics. Semantics could be separated into two categories: human and robot. Semantics in terms of the human describes a person’s understanding of the robot (or system) capabilities, task, and context. On the other hand, semantics in terms of the robot describes the robot’s understanding of the current task, environment, and the human interaction. Overall, this describes the basis of trust and reflects the goal-oriented nature of HRI." (p. 235-236)
