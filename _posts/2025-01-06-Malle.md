# Construct Summary

The authors define the dimensions of mind perception as Experience and Agency. The factor Experience includes 11 capacities: hunger, fear, pain, pleasure, rage, desire, personality, consciousness, pride, embarrassment, and joy. The second factor, Agency, includes seven capacities: self-control, morality, memory, emotion recognition, planning, communication, and thought.

**Comments**
The scale uses a nonstandard methodology of comparison for administration of the items therefore there was no formal validation of the individual items. Factor loadings in supplementary material. PCA does not require item removal. Validation method was convergent but scale was not compared to a previously validated measure.

# Final Scale Items (18 total):

From the supplementary material: "Respondents saw photos and vignettes on the characters in random order, and selected a survey from a set of descriptions of 18 mental capacities or 6 personal
judgments. For the survey, images and descriptions of the two characters
to be compared appeared with a five-point scale anchored by “Much more this one”
below each image, “Slightly more this one” next, and “Both equally” between the
images."
