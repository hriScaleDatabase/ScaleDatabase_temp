# Construct Summary

The authors define the construct of "Frankenstein Syndrome" as follows:

>"the act of creation, particularly innovative creation is seen as a taboo in Western cultures. In these cultures, the use of novel technologies is often seen as potentially problematic in itself, while other cultures, such as that of Japan, may have a more pragmatic view, judging innovations on their own merits. This phenomenon could manifest as an underlying factor in attitudes towards humanoid robots in a much greater extent in Western cultures than one would see in a Japanese population" (p. 3)
