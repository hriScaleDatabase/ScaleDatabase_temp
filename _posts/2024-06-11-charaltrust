# Final Scale Items (10 total):

<br>The way the robot moved made me uncomfortable 
<br>The speed at which the gripper picked up and released the components made me uneasy
<br>I trusted that the robot was safe to cooperate with 
<br>I was comfortable the robot would not hurt me 
<br>The size of the robot did not intimidate me 
<br>I felt safe interacting with the robot 
<br>I knew the gripper would not drop the components 
<br>The robot gripper did not look reliable 
<br>The gripper seemed like it could be trusted 
<br>I felt I could rely on the robot to do what it was supposed to do
