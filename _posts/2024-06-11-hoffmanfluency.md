# Construct Summary

The authors define the construct of fluency as follows (adding to test commit on VS codes):

>"When humans collaborate on a shared activity, and especially when they are accustomed to the task and to each other, they can reach a high level of coordination, resulting in a well-synchronized meshing of their actions. Their timing is precise and efficient, they alter their plans and actions appropriately and dynamically, and this behavior emerges often without exchanging much verbal information. We denote this quality of interaction the fluency of the shared activity." (p. 209)
