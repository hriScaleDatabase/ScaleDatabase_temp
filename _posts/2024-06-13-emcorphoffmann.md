# Construct Summary

A measure to assess users’ subjective perceptions of artificial entities’ capabilities related to embodiment and corporeality. The authors detail four capabilities that can explain effects of varying embodiments. They state those capabilities are (Nonverbal) Expressiveness, (Shared) Perception and Interpretation, Tactile Interaction and Mobility, and Corporeality. They initially define these sub-constructs as follows:

>Nonverbal Expressiveness relates to the entity’s ability to express itself with gestures, facial expressions etc. 
>(Shared) Perception refers to perceptual capabilities such as vision and hearing that can (but must not be) shared with the human interaction partner. 
>By Mobility we mean the capability to navigate in space, whereas Tactile Interaction refers to physical contact with humans and objects. 
>The core feature that is directly related to the physical embodiment of robots is Corporeality, i.e., the realism and material existence of the entity in the real world. (p. 372)
