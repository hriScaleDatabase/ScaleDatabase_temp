ITEM DEVELOPMENT
1.	Is the construct defined? 
2.	Does the final version of the items capture the construct as it has been defined by the authors?
3.	Is the item generation process discussed (e.g., literature review, Delphi method, crowd-sourcing)? (List experiment)
SCALE DEVELOPMENT (List experiment)
4.	Person to items 10:1 for the initial set of items?
5.	Did they perform an EFA, PCA, Rasch, or similar test to determine the item to factor relationship? 
6.	Did they describe how they determined number of factors?
7.	Did they report the full initial set of items?
8.	Did they provide loadings (EFA) or item fits (Rasch) of all items?
9.	Is there a description of the item removal process (e.g., using infit/outfit, factor loading minimum value, or cross-loading values)?
10.	Did they list the final number of items included in the scale?
SCALE EVALUATION (List experiment)
11.	Factor structure test (e.g., second EFA, CFA, DIF, test for unidimensionality when using Rasch, or similar)?
12.	Was a measure of reliability (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha, McDonalds Omega_h or Omega_t, Tarkkonen’s Rho) reported?
13.	Was a test of validity (e.g., predictive, concurrent, convergent, discriminant) reported?
