# Construct Summary

The authors aim to measure trust specifically in the context of industrial human-robot collaboration (HRC). They identify two main factors - robot performance and robot's physical attributes - that play a role in trust in industrial HRC contexts.

# Rating = 85%

# Final Scale Items (10 total):

The way the robot moved made me uncomfortable 
<br>The speed at which the gripper picked up and released the components made me uneasy
<br>I trusted that the robot was safe to cooperate with 
<br>I was comfortable the robot would not hurt me 
<br>The size of the robot did not intimidate me 
<br>I felt safe interacting with the robot 
<br>I knew the gripper would not drop the components 
<br>The robot gripper did not look reliable 
<br>The gripper seemed like it could be trusted 
<br>I felt I could rely on the robot to do what it was supposed to do
