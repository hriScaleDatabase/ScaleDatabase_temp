  <summary style="font-size: 30px;">Why didn't my scale get a 100% rating?</summary>
  <p>If a scale did not receive a perfect rating (13/13 points) then it is because the paper we reviewed either did not conduct the corresponding analysis or did not report it. We would like to make it clear that just because a scale has not received a perfect score using our guideline (as most scales have not) does not mean that it should not be used. We simply provide the reader/researcher with the information about the missing components in the scale development process to allow them to make as informed a decision as possible.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 30px;">How do I submit my new scale to be reviewed and included in the database?</summary>
  <p>Please submit it for review by emailing us at <a href="mailto:HRIscaleDatabase@gmail.com">HRIscaleDatabase@gmail.com</a> with "Scale Submission for Review" as the title.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 30px;">Why did we rate scales by the publications/papers instead of by the scale (i.e., collapsing across multiple papers)?</summary>
  <p>We made the decision to rate scales by paper to preserve as much information as possible. With the current design, the database will eventually include a repository of all the versions of a scale that have ever existed. This provides the reader/researcher with the freedom to choose which version of the scale they want to use in their research project.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 30px;">How do I figure out if a scale has been translated or validated?</summary>
  <p>If a scale has been translated, we will include a link to the publication in the comments section of the original version of the scale. If a scale has been validated, it will meet the criteria to receive a point (i.e., checkmark) on the final guideline item "Was a test of validity (e.g., predictive, concurrent, convergent, discriminant) reported?" on the scale's page in our database. Where possible, we will also include a link to the validation study (if it has not yet been rated by our team). If a scale has been validated and we have rated it (e.g. the avatar embodiment scale), then it will appear on the database page with a "- Validated" label next to the scale title.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 30px;">What if the scale I want to use is missing from your database?</summary>
  <p>That means we have not reviewed and rated it yet. Please submit it for review by emailing us at <a href="mailto:HRIscaleDatabase@gmail.com">HRIscaleDatabase@gmail.com</a> with "Scale Submission for Review" as the title.</p>
