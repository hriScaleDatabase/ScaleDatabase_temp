<h1 id="construct-summary">Construct Summary</h1>

<p>The authors identify the construct of avatar embodiment as consisting of 6 main factors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Body ownership. Present whenever there is a substitute body or body part. It is possible to have body ownership over a body that participants feel is not in the same location as their own body.</li>
    <li>Agency and motor control of the body. Present whenever there is motion tracking and the participant can move parts or all of the virtual body.</li>
    <li>Tactile sensations. Present whenever there is tactile or haptic stimulation to enhance the embodiment illusion.</li>
    <li>Location of the body. Present whenever there is a substitute body or body part that is either collocated or not collocated with the participant. Participants must feel that their body is in the same location as the virtual body in order to experience an embodiment illusion. Participants may sense an out-of-body effect, or that the location of their body has drifted toward the location of the avatar. These questions are often only asked when the avatar is not collocated with the participant.</li>
    <li>External appearance. Present when the self-avatar is a lookalike avatar or as control questions when there are shape, gender, race, clothing, or other visual modifications to the avatar different from the self.</li>
    <li>Response to external stimuli. In many occasions during the experiment there is an event that modifies or threatens the body or body parts of the self-avatar. If the participant is embodied in the self-avatar then the participant will react as if their own body is threatened. This is often measured through both questionnaire and quantitative response.” (p. 3-4)</li>
  </ol>
