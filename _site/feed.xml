<p>The authors define the perceived moral agency as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a measure of the human attribution of the status of a machine’s agency and/or morality (independent of whether it actually has agency or morality) (p.  365)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The scale consists of two dimensions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Morality, featuring a cluster of both rational and intuited morality items and Dependency, featuring semantically reversed items associated with both autonomy and intentionality, representing an absence of agency and reliance on programming or other human control. (p. 366)</p>

<p>The authors report that the scale was developed to measure “users’ perception of service robots” (p. 71) and “take the often-used concepts of anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, and perceived intelligence and perceived safety as starting points to propose a consistent set of five questionnaires for these concepts.” (p. 72)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><br />1. engagement - concern the learners’ involvement in the lesson (p. 385)
<br />2. enjoyment - aimed to measure the learners’ views of the robot as a source of entertainment in the class (p. 385)
<br />3. intention - reflect their intended communication with the robot in the future lessons (p. 385)
<br />4. anxiety - items that target to reveal the sources of fear, anxiety and avoidance associated with the use of robots in the class</p>

<p><strong>Engagement</strong>
<br />I try to make sense of the lesson better when a robot is used in the lesson.
<br />I can pay more attention to the lesson when there is a robot in the class.
<br />I can consider the robot as a teacher as it talks and moves like a human.
<br />I feel more interested in the topic when there is a robot in the class.
<br />I enjoy lessons that are handled using a robot.</p>

<p><strong>Enjoyment</strong>
<br />It is interesting to see a robot acting and talking like a human.
<br />Communicating with the robot is fun.
<br />I like communicating with the robot on a one-on-one basis.
<br />I enjoy it when the robot understands what I am saying and responds to me.</p>

<p><strong>Anxiety</strong>
<br />I don’t like the robot to be in the class.
<br />The existence of a robot in the class causes disrupt.
<br />Communicating with the robot is difficult.
<br />I feel nervous while talking with the robot.</p>

<p><strong>Intention</strong>
<br />I would like robots to take part in the lessons in the future.
<br />I would like to have a robot that would accompany me while studying at home.
<br />I would like robots to be utilized in other lessons as well.
<br />I think robots should be used in the lessons because the age of technology necessitates this.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="attitudes/attributes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the most up-to-date version of this scale.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Anthropomorphism Rasch</title><link href="http://hriscaledatabase.psychology.gmu.edu/anthropomorphism/2024/10/31/AP_HL.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Anthropomorphism Rasch" /><published>2024-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://hriscaledatabase.psychology.gmu.edu/anthropomorphism/2024/10/31/AP_HL</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://hriscaledatabase.psychology.gmu.edu/anthropomorphism/2024/10/31/AP_HL.html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>This is the most up-to-date version of this scale.</strong></p>

<p>A scale development method where the assumption is that the participants’ responses or overall score on a measure are a linear combination of their true ability plus random error. The goal in CTT is to get as close to the true score as possible by minimizing noise.</p>

<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
<p>A construct refers to the unobserved (i.e., latent) attitude, cognition, or attribute that is the target of the study. Unobserved (or latent) in this context simply refers to a type of construct that exists in the mind of the participant and cannot easily be directly observed. The term construct can be used interchangeably with other terms such as domain and latent variable.</p>

<h2 id="concurrent-validity">Concurrent Validity</h2>
<p>Measures the degree to which the performance on the current scale predicts performance on a criterion (gold standard) measurement. Typically, the two measures are administered at the same time or consecutively (hence “concurrent”). It is common, however, that no gold standard measure exists making evaluation of concurrent validity impossible; this is especially true in human robot interaction.</p>

<h2 id="construct-validity">Construct Validity</h2>
<p>Construct validity refers to the extent to which the scale measures what it was developed to measure and how much it is associated with other factors within the domain.</p>

<h2 id="convergent-validity">Convergent Validity</h2>
<p>Convergent validity refers to how well the new scale correlates with other variables that are designed to measure similar constructs.</p>

<h2 id="criterion-validity">Criterion Validity</h2>
<p>Criterion validity refers to the degree to which there is a relationship between the construct on the current scale and construct on another similar measure or in another context that is of interest to the researcher.</p>

<h2 id="custom-scale">Custom Scale</h2>
<p>Any scale that has not been validated.</p>

<h2 id="dimension">Dimension</h2>
<p>A psychological variable that represents a component of the construct that is captured by the items within a scale. This term is also used interchangeably with factor.</p>

<h2 id="discriminant-validity">Discriminant Validity</h2>
<p>Discriminant validity refers to the extent to which the scale differs from other unrelated constructs. Discriminant validity is measured by analyzing correlations between the measure of interest and other measures that do not measure the same domain or concept [6] where weaker correlations are expected.</p>

<h2 id="domain">Domain</h2>
<p>A domain refers to the unobserved (i.e., latent) attitude, cognition, or attribute that is the target of the study. It is often used interchangeably with “construct”.</p>

<h2 id="factor">Factor</h2>
<p>A psychological variable that represents a component of the construct that is captured by the items within a scale. This term is also used interchangeably with dimension.</p>

<h2 id="item">Item</h2>
<p>An item refers to the direct questions, directives, or statements that make up a scale. Each item within a scale is intended to capture the construct (i.e., attitude or behavior) either in part or in full.</p>

<h2 id="item-response-theory-irt">Item Response Theory (IRT)</h2>
<p>Item response theory uses an item-level approach to determining item and person fit within the scale.</p>

<h2 id="latent-variable">Latent variable</h2>
<p>The unobservable behavior, attitude, or attribute that is being measured. This term is often used interchangeably with construct and domain.</p>

<h2 id="predictive-validity">Predictive Validity</h2>
<p>Predictive validity is a type of validation method. It measures the degree to which performance on the current scale predicts performance on another scale taken at a later time.</p>

<h2 id="psychometrics-or-psychometric-theory">Psychometrics or Psychometric theory</h2>
<p>The scientific study of testing, measurement, and assessment int he social and behavioral sciences.</p>

<h2 id="rasch">Rasch</h2>
<p>One of the more common IRT models is the Rasch model. The Rasch model prioritizes invariance in measurement and can be thought of as a theory for how the data should be structured which can then be used to identify deviations in observed data. In other words, the Rasch model is a process for fitting data to a model.</p>

<h2 id="reliability">Reliability</h2>
<p>Reliability refers to the principle that a measurement produces similar results under similar conditions.</p>

<h2 id="scale">Scale</h2>
<p>The term “scale” refers to any instrument that measures a behavior, attitude, or other latent construct that isn’t directly observable.</p>

<h2 id="subscale">Subscale</h2>
<p>Subscales refer to complete sets of items that load onto one factor in an existing validated scale. For example, the competence subscale in the RoSAS consists of six items that are related to the intelligence or ability of the robot.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classical Test Theory (CTT) A scale development method where the assumption is that the participants’ responses or overall score on a measure are a linear combination of their true ability plus random error.
