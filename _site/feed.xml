<p>The authors define trust in automation as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“the attitude of a user to be willing to be vulnerable to the actions of an automated system based on the expectation that it will perform a particular action important to the user, irrespective of the ability to monitor or to intervene.” (p. 4)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the dimensions of mind? Our results suggest that people’s ascriptions of mental capacities follow at least three major axes.
Dimension A [positive and negative affect] unites aspects of physiological and positive as well as negative emotional capacities that are largely unintentional. 
Dimension 2 encompasses aspects of both moral cognition and social cognition, which itself includes the simulation of one’s own mind (e.g., planning) and others’ minds (e.g., inferring their thoughts); its appropriate label may thus be Moral &amp; Social Cognition. 
Dimension R [reality interaction] illustrates the dynamic transition from perception and cognition through learning to communication and action—a second more specific meaning of agency. (p. 6)</p>

<p>Bolded category labels are referred to as scales and italicized category labels are referred to as sub-scales in the paper.</p>

<p><strong>Human-related Factors</strong>
<em>Situation Awareness</em>
<br />wWhen working with the robot, I must pay close attention in order to obtain the necessary information
<br />There are times when I am unable to interpret the information obtained when working
with the robot</p>

<p><em>Resilience</em>
<br />When the robot is in trouble, I can keep my stress and fear under control
<br />I/m extremely highly adaptable to technical changes in the manufacturing line
<br />I know what I need to do to relax at work when situations get stressful</p>

<p><em>Self-efficacy</em>
<br />I am confident in my ability to do both easy and difficult job-related duties
<br />I believe I could accomplish my job if I worked in another robotics department instead
of this one
<br />I feel I have the skills required to work with robots</p>

<p><em>Trust</em>
<br />I am confident in the behavior of the robot with which I am working
<br />I am confident in the components generated by the robots because of robots’ high quality and precision
<br />I believe that the robots will be able to work for years without any major issues</p>

<p><em>Competency</em>
<br />I can comprehend a robot’s present condition and, if necessary, control it with suitable
inputs
<br />I am able to understand the topics essential to operate successfully with a robot by
attending training courses and classes
<br />I know how to tackle any problems that may develop when working with the robot</p>

<p><em>Affinity</em>
<br />Working on the production line with a robot attracts (excites) me
<br />I’m curious about how the robot operates
<br />It is not difficult for me to learn about and use new technology</p>

<p><em>Fear of substitution</em>
<br />I believe that in the near future robots will take over all jobs, leaving humans
unemployed</p>

<p><strong>Task-related Factors</strong>
<em>To remaining update</em>
<br />Because robots are advancing at such a quick speed, I must keep my knowledge up to
date
<br />In order to remain update, I have to attend several in-service classes</p>

<p><em>Job Demands</em>
<br />I’m tired of having to work on a robot that does not understand the meaning of fatigue
<br />The robots’ speed is too fast that I constantly find myself running out of time to work
with them (I am under time pressure)
<br />Working with the robot puts me under a great deal of mental and psychological
pressure</p>

<p><em>Environmental Condition</em>
<br />Due to bad working conditions, if I receive another job offer, I would very surely quit
my current job and take the new one 
<br />The environmental conditions in this robotic workplace, such as noise, vibration, and
dust, are extremely hazardous to my health, and I am concerned</p>

<p><em>Skill Utilization</em>
<br />My job required me to put my capabilities to practice 
<br />In my job, I use the training I received before/after my employment</p>

<p><em>Technical Support</em>
<br />The company’s technical staff arrives immediately to resolve the robot’s problems 
<br />In my opinion, the company’s technical experts have the essential expertise and competence to handle robot problems
<br />The training provided by the technical support team is sufficient to prevent the problem
from recurring</p>

<p><em>Decision Complexity</em>
<br />My job frequently compels me to make complex decisions. 
<br />My job is so difficult that I am embarrassed 
<br />Because there are so many, I’m not sure which regulation or guideline to use when an
issue emerges</p>

<p><strong>Robot-related Factors</strong>
<em>Usability</em>
<br />The robot with which I work in this unit is capable of achieving excellent results
<br />I’m satisfied with the robot with which I work. 
<br />My robot teammate is able to save time, money, and waste 
<br />This robot is easy to use 
<br />This robot gives the operator with useful feedback from the current situation</p>

<p><em>Level of Automation</em>
<br />I can adjust the robot if necessary (e.g. slowing it down)
<br />When I work at my job, I have complete control over the robot</p>

<p><em>Safety</em>
<br />So far, our colleagues have been involved in an accident caused by the robot’s malfunction rather than their own irresponsibility 
<br />In my opinion, the movement of The robot’s arms are extremely unsafe</p>

<p><em>Software/Hardware problems</em>
<br />This robot typically lacks the essential performance owing to a variety of software
issues such as hanging, locking, not responding appropriately to commands, and so on 
<br />In general, we have a lot of lost time because this robot broke down and they are fixing
it
<br />The robot has so many troubles that it requires a professional, up-to-date, and patient
maintenance team</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Attitudes/Attributes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the most up to date version of this scale.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Human Robot Interaction Evaluation Scale (HRIES)</title><link href="http://hriscaledatabase.psychology.gmu.edu/social/2025/01/06/HRIES.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Human Robot Interaction Evaluation Scale (HRIES)" /><published>2025-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://hriscaledatabase.psychology.gmu.edu/social/2025/01/06/HRIES</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://hriscaledatabase.psychology.gmu.edu/social/2025/01/06/HRIES.html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>This is the most up to date version of this scale.</strong></p>

<h1 id="construct-summary">Construct Summary</h1>

<p>The scale aims to measure the “the perception of robots in HRI psychosocial manipulations” (p. 1519) The authors propose a four factor definition of this construct:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Sociability] represents the social constructs that are positively related to the intent of interaction with others [40, 41, 134]. Sociability is the ability of an individual or a group of individuals to evolve in society. (p. 1522)
[Disturbance] represents the negative perception of robots in terms of uncomfortable feelings and perceptions. (p. 1522)
[Agency] regroups items relevant to the evaluation of the attribution of traits defined as “uniquely human” [50] with a form of agency. (p. 1523)
[Animacy] regroups items: “Human-like”, “Real”, “Alive”, and “Natural”, suggesting human characteristics for non-human agents. (p. 1523)</p>

<h1 id="construct-summary">Construct Summary</h1>

<p>The authors define the dimensions of mind perception as Experience and Agency. The factor Experience includes 11 capacities: hunger, fear, pain, pleasure, rage, desire, personality, consciousness, pride, embarrassment, and joy. The second factor, Agency, includes seven capacities: self-control, morality, memory, emotion recognition, planning, communication, and thought.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>
The scale uses a nonstandard methodology of comparison for administration of the items therefore there was no formal validation of the individual items. Factor loadings in supplementary material. PCA does not require item removal. Validation method was convergent but scale was not compared to a previously validated measure.</p>
