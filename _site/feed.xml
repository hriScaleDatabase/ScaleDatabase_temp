<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The authors define the construct of negative attitudes towards robots as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In considering negative attitudes toward robots, we need to take into account two psychological constructs related to it, which will be components of negative attitudes toward robots. One is the computer anxiety mentioned above, and the other is communication apprehension.” (p 440)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They define computer anxiety as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…considered to be anxiety or apprehension evoked in individuals when they use computers, do things leading them to computers, or think about the meaning of computers.” (p. 440)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They define communication apprehension as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…as a level of fear or anxiety in individuals toward real communication with another or others and prediction of it, such as speech, writing, singing, and so on.” (p. 441)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors define attitudes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is defined as a relatively stable and enduring predisposition to behave or react in a certain way toward persons, objects, institutions, or issues, and the source is cultural, familial, and personal.” (p. 440)</p>

<p>The authors use the same definition of trust as in their original publication:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Trust = a dyadic relation in which one person accepts vulnerability because they
expect that the other person’s future action will have certain characteristics; these
characteristics include some mix of performance (ability, reliability) and/or morality
(honesty, integrity, and benevolence)” (Malle &amp; Ullman, 2021, p. 12)</p>

<h1 id="construct-summary">Construct Summary</h1>

<p>The authors identify the construct of avatar embodiment as consisting of 6 main factors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Body ownership. Present whenever there is a substitute body or body part. It is possible to have body ownership over a body that participants feel is not in the same location as their own body.</li>
    <li>Agency and motor control of the body. Present whenever there is motion tracking and the participant can move parts or all of the virtual body.</li>
    <li>Tactile sensations. Present whenever there is tactile or haptic stimulation to enhance the embodiment illusion.</li>
    <li>Location of the body. Present whenever there is a substitute body or body part that is either collocated or not collocated with the participant. Participants must feel that their body is in the same location as the virtual body in order to experience an embodiment illusion. Participants may sense an out-of-body effect, or that the location of their body has drifted toward the location of the avatar. These questions are often only asked when the avatar is not collocated with the participant.</li>
    <li>External appearance. Present when the self-avatar is a lookalike avatar or as control questions when there are shape, gender, race, clothing, or other visual modifications to the avatar different from the self.</li>
    <li>Response to external stimuli. In many occasions during the experiment there is an event that modifies or threatens the body or body parts of the self-avatar. If the participant is embodied in the self-avatar then the participant will react as if their own body is threatened. This is often measured through both questionnaire and quantitative response.” (p. 3-4)</li>
