## How the guideline works

The guideline aims to help you pick the appropriate scale, evaluate whether it was developed adequately, and determine its validity as a measure.

<br>The guideline includes 13 high-level questions that can help you determine whether a candidate scale will be adequate for your research.

<br>The questions are grouped into the three stages of the scale development and validation process: item development, scale development, and scale evaluation.

# Item development

# Scale development

# Scale evaluation

<br>Note: the guideline includes recommendation for minimum acceptable criteria. Where possible we provide citations for recommendations with exact values. These values can and should be interepreted as heuristics. We do not encourage you to discard a scale simply because it does not meet a specific threshold that is suggested here.
