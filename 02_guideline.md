## How the guideline works

The guideline aims to help you pick the appropriate scale, evaluate whether it was developed adequately, and determine its validity as a measure. It includes 13 high-level questions that can help you determine whether a candidate scale will be adequate for your research. These guideline questions should be applied to the scale development or validation paper. If the scale does not meet the acceptable criteria (as outlined below or in the paper), then it does not get the point for that guideline question. The maximum number of points a scale can achieve is 13/13 or 100%. Below, we will provide a very high-level review of the information that is contained in the guideline. 

<br>The guideline questions are grouped into the three stages of the scale development and validation process: item development, scale development, and scale evaluation.

# Stage 1: Item development
Stage summary: Item development refers to the process by which the items of the scale are created. Each item is intended to capture the construct of interest either in part or in full. There are **three** main questions the reader can ask of the scale at this stage:

1. Is the construct that the scale attempting to measure defined clearly somewhere in the paper?
A clear and precise definition of the construct is critical. This can be achieved using a theory or data-driven approach depending on whether an agreed-upon theoretical framework of the construct exists or does not, respectively. The reader should ensure that the reported definition of the construct that is being measuring by the scale matches the construct of interest for their research project.

2. Is the item generation process discussed (e.g., via a literature review, the Delphi method, or crowd-sourcing)?
Look in the scale development paper for any information about how the items were generated. Typically authors generate items via a literature review (i.e., by reviewing existing scales and theoretical and empirical literature) but this can also be done using the Delphi method which is an iterative process that requires an expert panel to evaluate items. Lastly, another method that is common in HRI is what we call "crowd-sourcing" which refers to a broad variety of methods where lay persons are recuirted to consider their interpretation of the construct and provide their thoughts about items and stimuli.

3. Does the final version of the items capture the construct as it has been defined by the authors?
The first step is to ensure that the items are listed verbatim. If they are not, it is impossible to determine whether the items are approriate for your research. If the items are listed verbatim, refer back to the stated definition of the construct to ensure that the items are related to this definition. Specifically, ensure that there are no additional constructs that are captured in the final version of the scale.

# Stage 2: Scale development
Stage summary: Though there are many different methods for developing a scale (e.g., classical test theory or item response theory), there are some components of the process that are consistent across methods. This section of the guideline includes **seven** questions.

4. Did the scale developers report the full initial set of items?
Ensure that the developers of the scale made the full initial set of items publicly available, either by reporting them in the main text of the paper, in an appendix, or in an online repository. This is important because  it will allow the reader not only to determine whether the items capture the construct (i.e., guideline question three) but also whether the sample size is large enough to determine a factor structure (i.e., guideline question five). Additionally, the reader can determine if the factor loadings for all the items meet the relevant stated criteria (i.e., guideline question eight) and whether the scale developers removed items appropriately (i.e., guideline question nine). 

5. 
# Stage 3: Scale evaluation

<br>Note: the guideline includes recommendation for minimum acceptable criteria. Where possible we provide citations for recommendations with exact values. These values can and should be interepreted as heuristics. We do not encourage you to discard a scale simply because it does not meet a specific threshold that is suggested here.
